# Odin Domain Monitor

## Disclaimer

Odin is an example project built using [Maelstrom CMS Toolkit](https://www.maelstrom-cms.com/).

It is not a final release - it's an in-house tool which we use to provide basic monitoring with email alerts that receives regular bug fixes and new features as/when we need them internally.

We're simply open-sourcing it to allow others that might find it useful to use to use, we don't provide any support SLAs, however if bugs are found we'll investigate when we can, and if there's feature requests we'll consider. Pull Requests for new features/bug fixes are welcome, however we recommend opening an issue and discussing them before spending time doing it.

Theres no automated testing, and most likely won't work for anything less than PHP 7.3 - We run on nginx but would work on apache 2.4+

## What is it?

Odin is a domain monitoring tool which has the following monitors:

-   OpenGraph extraction.
-   Uptime Monitoring with response-time graph and e-mail notifications.
-   Downtime event tracking with duration.
-   SSL Certificate grading via SSL Labs.
-   SSL Health Monitoring with expiry and e-mail notifications.
-   Robots.txt Monitoring to email changes for review - No more accidentally blocking your website.
-   Basic DNS Monitoring to detect name-server and primary A Records changes
-   Cron job Schedule Monitoring - Ping the API before and after your jobs run to check they're running on schedule.
-   Website Crawling with Error Reporting - Crawls SSR websites and reports on 404s, errors, mixed-content warnings etc etc, if it appears in the browser console it will appear in here.

## Notifications Fired

-   CertificateHasExpired
-   CertificateIsExpiring
-   CertificateIsInvalid
-   CertificateIsWeak
-   CertificateWillExpire
-   VisualDifferenceFound
-   DnsHasChanged
-   RobotsHasChanged
-   WebsiteIsBackUp
-   WebsiteIsDown

## Installing

You should be able to follow any (good) up to date Laravel install guide, the jist is as follows:

-   git clone the repository
-   composer install
-   npm install
-   copy .env.example to .env and modify the settings
-   npm run dev/watch/prod

You can then visit the webpage and / register to create an account.

By default the Jobs are able to be queued and executed by a queue worker/horizon - We use horizon, but you can configure/protect this however you need.

## Using the Crawler

We use a modified version of the `spatie/browsershot` package which provides the crawling functionality, if you're unable to install puppeteer on your server, then you cannot use this feature.

Quick install for puppeteer:

macOS:

```sh
npm install puppeteer --global
```

Ubuntu 18 / 20:

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget

sudo npm install --global --unsafe-perm puppeteer

sudo chmod -R o+rx /usr/lib/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium
```

## Using the Visual Diff

The visual diff tool requires both `spatie/browsershot` (which uses puppeteer) and `Pixelmatch`

We use the following package to interact with the Pixelmatch node binaries: https://github.com/QortexDevs/laravel-visual-diff

Quick install: `npm i pixelmatch`

## Deploying

Deploying the project is very similar to installing it, the steps will differ depending on your hosting environment, there's plenty of tutorials online about how to deploy onto various platforms: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+deploy+laravel%20project
